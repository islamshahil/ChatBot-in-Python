Rotational Inertia
That property of an object to resist any change in its state of rotation. If at rest the body tends to remain at rest; if rotating, it tends to remain rotating and will continue to do so unless acted upon by a net external torque.
Torque
The product of force and lever-arm distance, which tends to produce rotation.
Center of Mass
The average position of mass or the single point associated with an object where all its mass can be considered to be concentrated.
Center of Gravity
The average position of weight or the single point associated with an object where the force of gravity can be considered to ace. Usually the same place as the center of mass.
Equilibrium
The state of an object when not acted upon by a net force or net torque. An object in equilibrium may be at rest or moving at uniform velocity; that is, not accelerating.
Centripetal Force
A center-seeking force that causes an object to follow a circular path. F = (mv`2)/r
Centrifugal Force
An outward force that is due to rotation. In an inertial frame of reference, it is fictitious in the sense that it doesn't act on the rotating object but on whatever supplied the centripetal force; it is the reaction to the centripetal force. In a rotating frame of reference, it does act on the rotating body and is fictitious in the sense that it is not an interaction with an agent or entity such as mass or charge but is a force in itself that is solely a product of rotation; it has no reaction-force counterpart.
Angular Momentum
A measure of an object's rotation about a particular axis; more specifically, the product of its rotational inertia and rotational velocity. For an object that is small compared to the radial distance, it is the product of mass speed, and radial distance of rotation.
Angular Momentum = rotational inertia x rotational velocity (mvr)
Conservation of Angular Momentum
When no external torque acts on an object or a system of objects, no changes of angular momentum takes place. Hence, the angular momentum before an event involving only internal torques is equal to the angular momentum after the event.
Law of Universal Gravitation
Every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that for two masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them. F = (G(m1*m2))/d^2
Inverse-Square Law
A law relating the intensity of an effect to the inverse square of the distance from the cause. Intensity ~ 1/distance`2

Spring Tide

Neap Tide

Escape Speed
That speed which is sufficient to propel an object away from a planet, or any object
Tides
Tides are caused by the variation of force on the earth exerted by the moon (and the sun). The effect of the moon is about 4 times greater than that of the sun.

For a satellite in circular orbit, it is always moving perpendicularly to the earth’s gravitational field. Because a satellite moves at right angles to the earth’s gravitational field, no change in speed occurs - only a change in direction. The higher the orbit of a satellite, the less it’s speed and the longer its period.

Light Waves
A soap bubble appears iridescent in white light when the thickness of the soap film is about the same as a wavelength of light. Bright fringes occur when waves (from both slits) arrive in phase; dark areas result from the overlapping of waves that are out of phase. Diffraction grating disperses white light into colors, and are used in spectrometers. The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave compared to the size of the obstruction that casts the shadow. The longer the wave compared to the obstruction, the more the diffraction occurs.
